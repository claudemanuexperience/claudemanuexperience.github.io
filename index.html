        <h2>About the Artist</h2>

        <div id="about">
            Claude Manu ― known to friends as Manu ― is a talented young artist
            from Brazil. Among her many virtues as a painter, she is especially
            known for her depiction of the <i>mar descendente</i>. Her work has
            garnered a worldwide audience, with famed American art critic
            William Roque writing: "every stroke of her brush will inspire yet
            another generation". Though the extent of her published works are
            limited to these as of today, we hope to see far more in the coming
            years.
